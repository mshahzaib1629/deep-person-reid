TODOS:
0. Save accuracy with timestamp after every model training


1. Create chunks that will be used to train model iteratively + write code for creating file containing id(s) of each chunk
2.0 Explore how to select & store samples for Representative Memory
2. Create samples for Representative Memory after every training
3. Explore ways to merge samples from RM with current chunk's image on starting training
4. Implement point 3 in Code
5. Explore ways to save model (or model weights ???) and how to reuse that model with new data
6. Implement point 5 in Code

7. Iteratively check accuracy either it drops or improve
